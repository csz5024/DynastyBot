# DynastyBot
Discord Bot for ESPN Dynasty Leagues

It should spawn the necessary JSON files, if not just create an empty JSON and it should work.
You need a chromedriver.exe that works with your version of chrome. (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
You have to be logged in to your ESPN profile in Chrome
You have to create a discord bot (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
You have to fill out the variable usermap and leagueId

This is very much a WIP, I will clean everything up in the coming days. Mostly just using this repo as a backup/port to AWS
